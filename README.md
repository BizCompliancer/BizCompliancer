### 1. Pexpect
Pexpect is a Python package for automating "test based" aka "command line" user facing applications. It works similar to linux expect. 
Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands. It can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can also be used to automate setup scripts for installing software package on different servers

#### Installation

    pip install pexpect

#### Usage

>There are two important methods in Pexpect ‚Äì expect() and send() (or sendline() which is like send() with a linefeed). 
> The expect() method waits for the child application to return a given string. The string you specify is a regular expression, so you can match complicated patterns. The send() method writes a string to the child application. From the child‚Äôs point of view it looks just like someone typed the text from a terminal. After each call to expect() the before and after properties will be set to the text printed by child application. The before property will contain all text up to the expected string pattern. The after string will contain the text that was matched by the expected pattern. The match property is set to the re match object.

*Note : Pexpect manual on shell script*
>Remember that Pexpect does NOT interpret shell meta characters such as redirect, pipe, or wild cards (>, |, or *). This is a common mistake. If you want to run a command and pipe it through another command then you must also start a shell.
